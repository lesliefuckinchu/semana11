              	<p class="p"> Making either cannabis oil or cannabutter employs essentially the same process. I always have both in my house. The butter I keep in the freezer, and the oil in the fridge.

When planning to make canna oil for homemade weed edibles, you need to determine which oil you want to use. The oils I use most often are olive, coconut and canola.

THC is released into the oil during the heating process, and the oils with a higher fat content absorb the most THC from the plant. Olive and coconut have higher fat content than canola. However, they really should not be heated to a super high temperature. (Once the THC is in any oil, you need to keep the heat relatively low, no boiling allowed. See note at bottom). <a href="#more">MORE</a> </p>

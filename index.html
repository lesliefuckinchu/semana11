              	<p class="p"> Infusion is often the most challenging part of cooking with cannabis and the reason why many people turn to their vaporizer in defeat. I’m here to tell you that you can do this! Not only is it doable, but it’s worth it.
The experience from start to finish is significantly different from the other common inhalation methods. The effects are typically longer, stronger, and slower to set in. For this reason, always start with a low dose and see how an edible affects you — especially if you’re cooking your own as it is impossible to calculate their potency. <br> Cannabis-infused oil is probably the most versatile medium and a great place to start, since it can be used for baking desserts, sautéing veggies, frying up your morning eggs, or in your salad dressing. In addition, as is the case with cooking anything at home, you have complete control over its preparation. Does peanut oil hold a special place in your heart? Make cannabis-infused peanut oil! </p>
